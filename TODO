1. Grab top 20 twitch.tv channels
    - will periodically update - every 15 minutes?
        - channels will be filtered by the view count
    - irc bot will join/part channels as they update
2. Start looking at chat for Kappa's
    - Store database for each stream the Kappa count
3. Update the webpage with updated Kappa counts
    - communicate with websockets? (maybe just poll for now)
